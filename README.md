The teacher has to ignore the mark for any 1 subject, and calculate the total marks of each student in the other subjects and then sort the marks in ascending order. The teacher decided to ignore the mask of the same subject for each student.

    ##### Example
    ```sh
    std: 3
    mar: 5
    arr: [[48,89,31,10,100], [45,67,89,34,54], [92,73,54,10,90]]

    Output: [309, 268, 255]
